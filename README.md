The Faculty of Computing and Informatics (FCI) is faced with numerous requests during application
and registration phases. Sometimes, the faculty cannot keep with the load of these requests.
Therefore, FCI is looking for a chatbot to deliver feedback to students, applicants and anyone
requesting information about the faculty and its programmes. 

In this assignment in groups of three we have developed a chatbot application for FCI.
